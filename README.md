Hello !
My name is Shreyas Choudhari.
I am student of National Institute of Technology Agartala.
In this project I have made a Todo List using react js
Inside App.js I have created a form in which user have to enter the task and click on Submit button.
As soon as user clicks on Submit, the task will be added to the Todo list.
This is done with the help of AddTodo component using map() function in react.
